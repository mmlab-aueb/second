## About
This is the github repository of the **Securing Content Delivery and Provenance
(SECOND)** project. The project investigates the application of self-certifying identifiers, certificateless public key cryptography,
and group signatures with BBS+ support, to
Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm. In particular it experiments with a self-managed
form of Decentralized Identifiers referred to as [did:self](https://github.com/mmlab-aueb/did-self),
an extension to did:self that supports human readable names using [CP-PKE](https://github.com/mmlab-aueb/charm),
and [BBS+ group digital signatures](https://github.com/mmlab-aueb/zkp-toolkit)
applied to [Named Data Networking](https://named-data.net) architecture. For more information about
the project, visit the project's [homepage](https://mm.aueb.gr/projects/second). 

This project is funded by[NGIatlantic.eu](https://ngiatlantic.eu/about-ngiatlanticeu-initiative)
